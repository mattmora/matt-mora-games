<h2>About</h2>
<hr>
<p>
	I'm a game designer and programmer currently pursuing an MFA at the NYU Game Center. In addition to game design,    I have a
	background in music composition and audio programming, and I dabble in 2D art and animation.
</p>
<p>
	I'm interested in generative and procedural systems, emergent play, experimental games, music
	games, web games, and more.
</p>
<p>
	Currently, I make lots of small games and prototypes, which are playable on my
	<a href="https://mattmora.itch.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">itch.io</a> page. You
	can read about some of my games and my process by selecting the panels below.
