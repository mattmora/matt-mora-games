		<h3>Why do I sometimes go by mattmora?</h3>
		<hr />
		<p>
			<b>Matt Wang</b> is a such a common name that any reasonable variation of it is usually taken
			as a username (or domain name!). <b>Mora</b> is my mom's last name, which is of course much less
			common, so I use that instead.
		</p>
		<p>
			Besides that, I assume it's better for SEO, the alliteration is nice, and I see using either
			name where appropriate as an acknowledgment of my identity as a mixed race person.
		</p>
		<p>But I'm fine with being called whatever - Matt, Matthew, Wang, Mora.</p>
